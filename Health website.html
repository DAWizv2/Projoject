                        A Well-rounded, nutritious diet is essential for good health. This includes:

                        <li>Fruits and Vegetables: Aim for a variety of colors and types to get a range of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. Try to eat at least 5 servings of fruits and vegetables daily.</li>

                        <li>Whole Grains: Whole grains like oats, brown rice, quinoa, and whole-wheat bread are rich in fiber, which aids digestion and helps regulate blood sugar levels.</li>

                        <li>Lean Proteins: Include lean proteins like chicken, fish, tofu, beans, and legumes. Protein is essential for muscle growth, repair, and immune function.</li>

                        <li>Healthy Fats: Incorporate healthy fats such as those from olive oil, nuts, avocados, and fatty fish like salmon. These fats are good for heart health.</li>

                        <li>Hydration: Drinking plenty of water is crucial for maintaining body functions, from digestion to temperature regulation. Aim for 8 cups (about 2 liters) per day, though individual needs may vary.</li>
